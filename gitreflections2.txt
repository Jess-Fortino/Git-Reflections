Git questions, lesson 2
1.)What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository makes a .git file appear in the file, it helps
to keep track of every change that is made in the file.

2.)How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a midway point between an actual commit and
before logical changes are made. The value of the staging area
I believe is the opportunity to have fewer mistakes, this state
allows you to focus on the changes you've made and stop them
from happening.

3.) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one
commit per logical change?

Simply by using git diff (which allows you to look at the
differences between the working directory and the staging area)
and git diff --staged (which allows you to look at the
differences between the staging area and the most recent commit)
will allow you to make sure that what you are commiting is in fact
a logical change.
