1.) When would you want to create a remote repository rather
than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on more than one computer, or when you are working with a collaborator.
Plus there is always that frightening moment if you're computer freezes or crashes and you lose
everything you were just working on.

2.) Why might you always want to pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?

Because you may have made changes to either repository,
local or on github that you don't want transferred yet.
Manually updating ensures that you have everything you want
in either version of the repository.

3.) Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches.
When would you use one instead of the other?

Forks and clones are very similar-- one just happens to be
solely based on the platform- Github-fork. Whenever you clone
or fork, this will have you create an entirely new file as
opposed to a branch- with branches, you are working on
the main file as opposed to a whole new one. You would use
branches if you are working on something you know will be integrated
or that you think you'd like to do. You clone or fork, when you
either want to use an idea from that file, or when you want to
pull an idea from it.
