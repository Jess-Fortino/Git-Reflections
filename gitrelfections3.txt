1.) When would you want to create a remote repository rather
than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on more than one computer, or when you are working with a collaborator.
Plus there is always that frightening moment if you're computer freezes or crashes and you lose
everything you were just working on.

2.) Why might you always want to pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?

Because you may have made changes to either repository,
local or on github that you don't want transferred yet.
Manually updating ensures that you have everything you want
in either version of the repository.
